				<p>Hello, my name is Danu and I am a student at HAW</p>
				<p>This is a web site in progress that I do in order to learn the Spring framework and improve my skills at java back-end development</p>
				<p>The web site is designed as an event posting platform. Each event has a location, a date, a body, an author and some other things I might decide to add...</p>
				<p>It is basically a private minicalendar for me and a group of friends and colleagues</p>
				<p>Of course only me and my trusted colleagues can log in and post events </p>
				
				<p>I use thymeleaf for rendering content instead of jsp's: <b><a href="http://www.thymeleaf.org/">www.thymeleaf.org/</a></b> </p>
				<p>Spring is really cool so far...</p>
